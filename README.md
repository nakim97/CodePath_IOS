Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Simple Launch Screen with App Name and Logo ($)
- [X] App Icon taken from free assets

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

As it was my first time working with Xcode and Swift, I found myself struggling learning the interface. However, I found the guide/youtube tutorial to be useful and saw some similarities between Swift/Xcode and CSS/JS, and was able to grasp a better understanding of the topics. While a lot of the features are still foreign, I look forward to having the opportunity to get a better understanding of the interface and be able to implement all these features towards future projects!
